# ModifiedSpaceInvaders
Space Invaders game in Assembly 
This is my last readme for v1.0. I ultimately decided to do a simplified version of Space Invaders. 
The game reads x values from the potentiometer and a button allows the player to shoot enemy ships, or blocks above it.
When the player shoots all the blocks the player has won the game, and it cuts to an end game screen. 
I use a timer in overflow interrupt mode instead of a delay.
